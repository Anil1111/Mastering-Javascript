    /*
    Description
    This method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating
    the string into substrings.
    
    Syntax
    Its syntax is as follows −
    string.split([separator][, limit]);

    Argument Details
        separator − Specifies the character to use for separating the string. If separator is omitted, the array returned contains one element consisting of the entire string.
        limit − Integer specifying a limit on the number of splits to be found.

    Return Value
    The split method returns the new array. Also, when the string is empty, split returns an array containing one empty string, rather than an empty array.
