          The length property returns the number of URLs in the history list of the current browser window.
          The property returns at least 1, because the list includes the currently loaded page.
          Tip: This property is useful to find out how many pages the user has visited in the current browsing session.
          Note: Internet Explorer and Opera start at 0, while Firefox, Chrome, and Safari start at 1.
          Note: Maximum length is 50.  
          Note: This property is read-only.
