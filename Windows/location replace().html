      /*Definition:
          The replace() method replaces the current document with a new one.
          The difference between this method and assign(), is that replace() removes the URL of the current document from the document history, meaning that it is not possible to use the "back" button to navigate back to the original document.
        Tip: Use the assign() method if you want to load a new document, and the option to navigate back to the original document.
