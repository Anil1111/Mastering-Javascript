      /*Definition :
          The window.matchMedia() method returns a MediaQueryList object representing the results of the specified CSS media query string.
          The value of the matchMedia() method can be any of the media features of the CSS @media rule, like min-height, min-width, orientation, etc.
          The MediaQueryList object has two properties and two methods:

          Property 	Description
          matches 	Used to check the results of a query. Returns a boolean value: true if the document matches the media query list, otherwise false
          media 	A String, representing the serialized media query list

          The first example on this page only runs the specified CSS media query and compares it to the current window state once.
          To use window.matchMedia() in a responsive manner, to make your code react to a CSS media query whenever the window state changes,
          you can use its methods/event handlers (See "More Examples" below):
          
          Method 	Description
          addListener(functionref) 	Adds a new listener function, which is executed whenever the media query's evaluated result changes
          removeListener(functionref) 	Removes a previously added listener function from the media query list. Does nothing if the specified listener is not already in the list
          */
      function myFunction() {
        var x = document.getElementById("demo");
        if (window.matchMedia("(max-width: 700px)").matches) {
          x.innerHTML = "The screen is less than, or equal to, 700 pixels wide.";
        } else {
          x.innerHTML = "The screen is at least 700 pixels wide.";
        }
      }
