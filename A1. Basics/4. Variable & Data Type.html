    1. Infinity = represents the mathematical Infinity. It is a special value that's greater than any number.
    2. -Infinity and NaN = represents the computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation. */

    2. Single quotes ('')

In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
